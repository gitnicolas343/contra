# Contributing

## Branching
- Use feature branches off `develop`.
- Merge to `develop` first, then `main` when ready.

## Formatting
- Python: keep functions small, prefer explicit names.
- JS/CSS: no inline styles/scripts, keep page-specific files.

## Frontend standards
- Use shared styles in `base.css` and `auth.css`.
- Keep buttons and modals consistent.

## Backend standards
- Separate routers, services, and clients.
- Add endpoints through routers only.

## Checklist
- Run app locally and verify page renders.
- Confirm endpoints used by HTML still match backend routes.
